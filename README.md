## Requirements
* fastai library
* Kaggle account

## Getting Started 
All instructions can be found in the Jupyter notebook. Use GPU hardware accelerator for shorter training times.  

## Data
Data for training was taken from Kaggle: [Fruits 360](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits).  
You can also use your own dataset. You can refer to the [fast.ai documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/) for details on how to load your own dataset.
